# topic_modelling_ETM
All implementations of Embedded Topic Modelling from Dieng, Ruiz, and Blei, are absolutely horrible including their own. Amazing theory but such non-pythontic code. This repo also contains an LDA model because LDA topic modeling was the predecesor to ETM, where ETM beats LDA in almost all aspects.
