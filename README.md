# topic_modelling_ETM
This is an amazing Embedded Topic Model for cateogory learning.

All previous implementations of Embedded Topic Modelling from Dieng, Ruiz, and Blei, are horrible. Good theory but awful non-pythonic code. This repo has solved that. Furthermore, this repo contains an LDA model because LDA topic modeling was the predecesor to ETM, where ETM beats LDA in almost all aspects. Analysis below. LDA model was written by me, ETM model was written by me, Antony Z, and Hassan A.
